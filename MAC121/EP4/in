Nurse was too old and devoted a friend to be excluded from the
 family councils, and Miss Vernon was too well acquainted with her
 affectionate self-forgetful nature to consider her question intrusive.

 "Only some business, dear nurse; it may be troublesome or may not, but
 cannot be avoided, even by your good advice; so just bring down the
 boxes, and you shall hear more when I have more to tell, and, nurse,"
 turning back from the dining-room door, "should Mr. Winter or Mr.
 Gilpin, or any one call, you had better say that grandpapa and I are
 particularly engaged."

 "The Lord look down on me!" soliloquised Mrs. O'Toole, as she crossed
 herself, with an air of alarm, "not see Winther nor the crather iv an
 Organist. Faith there is throuble gotherin sure enough, I knew be the
 darlint's two eyes there was throuble in her heart this week past;
 sure we were too long quiet an happy, that thim divils iv attorneys
 should remember us. I'll go bail, it was thim that druv the captin
 off to that murtherin hot counthry, an I thinkin he an mee sweet
 child id make it up betune thim. The masther's as innocent as a lamb,
 but lave ould nurse alone for seein as far into a mill stone as her
 naybors ow wow; many a time, I seen him takin the full iv his eye,
 out iv her, an I removin the tay things. Och! bud it's the wearisome
 world! Susy yer idle gowk, are ye goin to lave me to pull the arrums
 out of mee, liftin a ton weight here, widout puttin a finger to help
 me?"

 And diligently did the Colonel and his granddaughter untie, read, and
 examine, and re-tie the numerous bundles of papers and letters.

 Now a packet in Lady Desmond's clear firm writing was laid aside, now
 a smaller one in Kate's own hand; rapturous letters, describing the
 enjoyments of her memorable visit to London, the only time she had
 ever been away from her grandfather; now turning over large yellow
 parchments, with red seals hanging from them, now eagerly examining a
 pile of papers whose crabbed writing bespoke business. It was weary
 work; Kate, with all the hopeful energy of youth, rapidly searching
 through each of the packets at all likely to contain a solicitor's
 letter, and handing them to her grandfather, who, latterly, leaned
 wearily back in his chair, and examined them languidly. Once his arm
 stole round her, as she knelt beside the pile of papers on the floor,
 and she felt how eloquent of despondency, was the close embrace with
 which he held her to him; but she constrained herself to receive it
 in silence, and took no further notice than to kiss, warmly, the hand
 which pressed her to his heart, as the last and best treasure left him.

 "You are tired and cold," said she, rising, "I will stir the fire, and
 then, come and put your feet on the fender, and I will replace these
 packets we have examined in the box, and open all Lady Desmonds'
 letters, some such paper may have got among them."
